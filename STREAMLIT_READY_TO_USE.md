# 🎉 Streamlit Web Dashboard - READY TO USE!

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The asyncio event loop error has been **completely fixed**!

```
❌ Before: Error processing request: <asyncio.locks.Event object at 0x10c44f830 [unset]> 
          is bound to a different event loop

✅ After:  Agent responds with intelligent answers - No errors!
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Start MCP Server
```bash
# Terminal 1
python scripts/run_server.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Step 2: Start Streamlit Dashboard
```bash
# Terminal 2
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

You should see:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser
```
http://localhost:8501
```

### Step 4: Ask a Question
```
Type: "Can I use 151.5 MHz for a training exercise?"
Press: Enter
Result: Agent responds with intelligent answer ✅
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
- Streamlit runs synchronously (no event loop)
- LangGraph agents are asynchronous (use asyncio)
- Creating new event loops each time caused asyncio objects to be bound to different loops
- Result: "bound to a different event loop" error

### The Solution
1. **Added nest_asyncio** - Allows nested event loops
2. **Created async wrapper** - Contains async logic
3. **Created sync wrapper** - Bridges Streamlit and async code
4. **Updated main function** - Uses sync wrapper

### The Result
✅ No more event loop errors
✅ Proper async handling
✅ Clean, maintainable code
✅ Streamlit works perfectly

## 📝 Changes Made

### File 1: pyproject.toml
```toml
dashboard = [
    "streamlit>=1.31.0",
    "plotly>=5.18.0",
    "nest-asyncio>=1.5.0",  # ← Added
]
```

### File 2: dashboard/app.py
```python
# Added at top
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

# Added async wrapper
async def process_user_input_async(user_input: str, agent, mcp_client):
    # ... async logic ...

# Added sync wrapper
def process_user_input(user_input: str, agent, mcp_client):
    # ... sync wrapper that calls async function ...

# Updated main function
response = process_user_input(user_input, agent, mcp_client)
```

## 💬 Example Conversation

```
You: Can I use 151.5 MHz for a training exercise?

Agent: I'll check the spectrum plan and deconfliction status for 151.5 MHz.
Based on the current allocations, 151.5 MHz is available for your training 
exercise. The frequency has good separation from existing allocations and 
no interference issues detected. I recommend:
- Frequency: 151.5 MHz
- Bandwidth: 25 kHz
- Duration: As needed for training
- Power: Standard training levels

You: What about 225 MHz?

Agent: 225 MHz is currently allocated to tactical operations. However, I can 
suggest alternative frequencies in the same band that are available:
- 224.5 MHz (available)
- 225.5 MHz (available)
- 226.0 MHz (available)

Would you like me to allocate one of these alternatives?

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "MCP server is not responding"
```bash
# Make sure server is running in Terminal 1
python scripts/run_server.py
```

### "Connection refused"
```bash
# Check that port 8000 is available
lsof -i :8000
```

### "Streamlit not found"
```bash
# Install Streamlit
pip install streamlit
```

### "nest_asyncio not found"
```bash
# Install nest_asyncio
pip install nest-asyncio
```

### "No response from agent"
```bash
# Check server logs
tail -f logs/embm_agents.log
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner
1. Start server: `python scripts/run_server.py`
2. Start dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard/app.py`
3. Ask simple questions: "Can I use 151.5 MHz?"

### Intermediate
1. Try complex queries: "What frequencies work for 6 units?"
2. Follow-up questions: "Can we use frequency hopping?"
3. Check system status in sidebar

### Advanced
1. Examine logs: `tail -f logs/embm_agents.log`
2. Modify system prompt: Edit `agents/spectrum_manager/agent.py`
3. Add custom queries: Extend the agent
